This directory contains release 1.0 of the multi-stream SSDs storage subsystem
simulator.  For more details check out and if using then must cite the following publication,

"Bhimani J, Mi N, Yang Z, Yang J, Pandurangan R, Choi C, Balakrishnan V. FIOS: Feature Based I/O Stream Identification for Improving Endurance of Multi-Stream SSDs. In2018 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2018). IEEE 2018 Jul 1." 

To quickly verify that you've got everything and that it works:

  1. "make" the top-level directory. It will creat executable named msssdsim in the main directory. The sample executable is incluted in this git repository.
    
  2. To run the simulator as legacy SSD use - "./msssdsim -f <input block trace file> -d <input dictionary file> -s <flash SSD size in 512 byte sectors> -r (consider 'read' as 'write' in the first loop) -l <number of loops> ". 

  3. To run the simulator as legacy SSD use - "./msssdsim -f <input block trace file> -d <input dictionary file> -s <flash SSD size in 512 byte sectors> -m <number of streams> -c <multi-stream algorithm> -r (consider 'read' as 'write' in the first loop) -l <number of loops>".  

  4. Script "msssdsim.sh" lists some examples to run this simulator such as:

  	a) Legacy SSD: " ./msssdsim -f ../../data/8cass/blktrace_nvme0n1.log -d ../../data/8cass/Freq/nvme0n1/dictionary.log -s 170000000  -r -l 2"

  	b) Multi-stream SSD: " ./msssdsim -f ../../data/8cass/blktrace_nvme0n1.log -d ../../data/8cass/Freq/nvme0n1/dictionary.log -s 170000000 -m 16 -c 4 -r -l 2"
